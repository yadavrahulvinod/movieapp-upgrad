Dear Invigilator, this is my 'Project Write-Up'.
I request you to kindly go through it.
Thank you.


1) When you download the Zip file from my GitHub link "https://github.com/sun241moon/Movie_App" and when you extract the Zip, you will get The Main Project Folder called "Movie_App-main"

2) This "Movie_App-main" folder shall contain 2 subfolders namely "frontend" and "backend" along with this "Readme.md" file and 2 other files called "Example Error 1" and "Example Error 2"

3) The 'Starter Code Files' that were initially provided to us by Upgrad by the name "Movie Booking Application Frontend Code.Zip", i have put them in the folder 'frontend'

4) And the 'Files-&-Folder Structure' that i was suppose to create in "Checkpoint 2" i have created them within the folder 'backend'. (Please note that i was suppose to name this folder as 'moviebooking' as per the instructions provided in Checkpoint 2. But i have named it 'backend' instead, for the purpose of easy explanation)

So basically, the entire project files are divided & stored in 2 separate folders - "frontend' which has all the front end files and "backend" which has all the backend files.

----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----

Please follow the below steps in order to run/execute the app =

Step 1 --> Before running the project, we will need to install the project dependencies. And so, go to the 'frontend' folder from Command Line and run the 'npm install' command.

Step 2 --> Now go to the 'backend' folder from Command Line and run the 'npm install' command in here also.

Now, after all the dependencies are installed, the project is ready to be deployed.

Step 3 --> Now, go to the 'backend' folder from the command line terminal and run either of these two commands - 'npm run dev' or 'node server.js' (Please note that the MongoDb-Database needs to be configured & ready at your end, before you run this command.)

Note 1 - The server.js is the index file of the backend where 'Server Initializaton using Express takes place'
Note 2 - MongoDb connection will be established as soon as the server get started.

Step 5 --> Now, navigate to the 'frontend' folder using the command line and then run the 'npm start' command, and this will spin up the 'React App'

Now, the peoject will be deployed and it will be ready to use.

Note 1 = frontend URL : http://localhost/3000
Note 2 = backend URL : http://localhost/8085

IMPORTANT = When the App is deployed you may come across some errors as shown in the 2 files "Example Error 1" and "Example Error 2". These error are related to React/Front end. These errors  You can simply click the 'X' button (close button) and continue. For more info, please check these 2 files "Example Error 1" and "Example Error 2".

I am facing a little error while working with 'Coupons and Fetching them'.
It was a little confusing for me. However I have tried my best and made sure that all other features are working well.

Thank You.
